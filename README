to run TrueGrid files:
  (1) open a Windows Command Prompt as an Administrator
  (2) from the command line, write:
        >tg -i=spar_station_04.tg

to postprocess TrueGrid files:
  run "main.py" from the command line
  or, in iPython: |>run main

Notes:
------
(1) PYTHON must already be installed on your system
(2) the "license" file must be in the top directory (spardesign) in order for
    VABS to run correctly
(3) TrueGrid must already be installed on your system

Other remarks:
--------------
(1) everything has been recently changed to use TrueGrid for mesh generation
for now, all the development files are in the "truegrid" directory
(2) old Mayavi-specific gridgen files have been moved to the "deprecated/autogridgen" directory
