(1) write TrueGrid scripts
(from iPython):
  |>cd github\spardesign\truegrid
  |>run writeTGscripts

(2) run TrueGrid scripts and write ABAQUS output files
(from Admin Windows Command Prompt):
  >alltg

(3) translate ABAQUS output files to VABS input files and run VABS
(from iPython ... stations 1-6 take about 4 minutes to run):
  |>cd ..
  |>run main

(4) retrieve mass and stiffness matrices in each of the *.dat.K files

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
------
(1) PYTHON must already be installed on your system
(2) the "license" file must be in the top directory (spardesign) in order for
    VABS to run correctly
(3) TrueGrid must already be installed on your system

Other remarks:
--------------
(1) everything has been recently changed to use TrueGrid for mesh generation
for now, all the development files are in the "truegrid" directory
(2) old Mayavi-specific gridgen files have been moved to the "deprecated/autogridgen" directory
